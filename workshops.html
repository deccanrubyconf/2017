          Attend one of our workshops to gain hands-on practical knowledge from
          our experienced workshop conductors. The workshops will be held
          separately from the one day conference and the workshop tickets need
          to be purchased separately as well. Both the workshops will be full day
          events and the venue will be reflected in our schedule.

        <p>

          Found yourself tangled up in hard-to-maintain code? Been building app after app in the same way and never
          finding a way to make significant improvements? Vaunted object-oriented design principles proving too elusive
          or hard to apply? Thinking maybe it’s time to leave Ruby <i>(gasp!)</i> for something different?

        </p>

        <p>
          If you’ve answered yes to any of these questions, this workshop is for you!
        </p>

        <p>
          Come along and learn how to build a new generation of Ruby web app with <a src="">dry-rb</a> : an app that is
          robust, cleanly architected, and just as easy to build now as it will be to maintain later.
        </p>


        <p>
          At the end of the day, you’ll have made some real steps towards levelling up as a software developer. You’ll
          have explored a different paradigm in application design, practiced working with many new gems (15 at least
          count!), and hopefully found a new enthusiasm for Ruby and how you can wield it to write better, cleaner code.
        </p>

        <p>
          This workshop is intended for developers with some experience working with Ruby. You’ll need your own laptop
          and a ready-to-go Ruby development environment.

          Relational DB, SQL, Joins, Constraints. Oh the horrors! Who needs to look there, when you have Active Record
          models! Well, anyone who is serious about writing production quality software. This is where we'll start. Come
          level up your database skills and learn how to leverage databases in your apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will be discussing how to build a robust persistence layer for your application through good schema
          design, SQL best practices, and data integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a practical, hands-on approach, using Sequel and ActiveRecord and plain ol' SQL,
          we will look into the whys, the hows, and the gotchas of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>ER Modelling</li>
          <li>Schema design</li>
          <li>Middle tables, joins</li>
          <li>Constraints, Checks, and Indexes</li>
          <li>Locks and Transactions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the end of the day, we aim to :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Leave you with practical tips, tricks you can start using from the next day!</li>
          <li>Make the database layer less opaque to you, help you understand it more.</li>
          <li>Point you in the right direction for seeking further knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This workshop is intended for people with at least some experience working on database backed applications
          with Ruby / Rails / Sinatra.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will need a laptop with working Ruby, and Postgres. Detailed installation instructions will be provided
          to all those who register.
