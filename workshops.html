          Attend one of our workshops to gain hands-on practical knowledge from
          our experienced workshop conductors. The workshops will be held
          separately from the one day conference and the workshop tickets need
          to be purchased separately as well. Both the workshops will be full day
          events and the venue will be reflected in our schedule.

          Next generation web apps with dry-rb

          Found yourself tangled up in hard-to-maintain code? Been building app after app in the same way and never finding a way to make significant improvements? Vaunted object-oriented design principles proving too elusive or hard to apply? Thinking maybe it’s time to leave Ruby <i>(gasp!)</i> for something different?

        </p>

        <p>
          If you’ve answered yes to any of these questions, this workshop is for you!
        </p>

        <p>
          Come along and learn how to build a new generation of Ruby web app with <a src = "">dry-rb</a> : an app that is robust, cleanly architected, and just as easy to build now as it will be to maintain later.
        </p>


        <p>
          At the end of the day, you’ll have made some real steps towards levelling up as a software developer. You’ll have explored a different paradigm in application design, practiced working with many new gems (15 at least count!), and hopefully found a new enthusiasm for Ruby and how you can wield it to write better, cleaner code.
        </p>

        <p>
          This workshop is intended for developers with some experience working with Ruby. You’ll need your own laptop and a ready-to-go Ruby development environment.

         Relational DB, SQL. Oh the horrors! Who needs to look there when you have ActiveRecord models. Well, anyone who is serious about writing production quality software. This would be a good place to start.
