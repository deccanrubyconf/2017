          The World Full of Idiots by Ajey Gore
        </p>

        <p>
          The guiding principles become rules in 2 generations, you forget why do you do something, I hate the way people see others when they don't use appropriate tools and community turns you off in terms of not being that acceptable, this happened with me very early on around tests and why testing it important, this talk talks about what clicked and hopefully it will do that for you as well

          In a HTTP/2 World by Douglas Vaz
        </p>
      
        <p>
         With the onset of HTTP/2 adoption, we need to rethink conventional views of servers and clients. Binary protocols and features like server push open up a whole new aspect of how we can design services and web apps on a modern software stack by taking advantage of new standards.

          Sanity on Rails — How to write maintainable Rails applications in 2017 by Michael Kohl
        </p>

        <p>
         Rails is not your application! Don’t overcomplicate your development life by trying to make everything fit within its MVC structure. A framework provides tools and abstractions, use them to build your business logic, don’t force your business logic to fit into them.
